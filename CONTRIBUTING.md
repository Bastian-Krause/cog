Source Repository
-----------------

Dinghy's source repository is hosted at:

> https://github.com/Igalia/dinghy

Development happens in the `master` branch, which must be always buildable.


Reporting Bugs
--------------

Please report bugs at https://github.com/Igalia/dinghy/issues â€” you can also
browse the issues already reported, and in case someone has already reported
your bug, do not hesitate to add additional information which may help solve
it.

A general advice for bug reports is to mention the version of WebKit that
you are using, and which steps can be followed to reproduce the issue.


Hacking on Dinghy
-----------------

### Working on the source

Please read the [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) file, which describes the
structure of the source code and some design decisions. That hopefully will
make the code easier to navigate.

### Creating and sending a patch

*(TODO)*
